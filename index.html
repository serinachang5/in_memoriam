                <p>Here's where a written explanation will go. You'll hear streams of 16th notes. Each stream represents a mass shooting event, the number of 16th notes in the stream equals the number of victims in the shooting, and the start time of the stream is based on when the event occurred in real life. We start in January 2000, and each month passes by with the duration of a dotted eighth note. </p>            
                <p>Please listen with care to those around you, and to yourself.</p>
